# Vertx + MongoDB REST API boilerplate
Boilerplate for REST API projects using [Vertx](http://vertx.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). This application is ready to deploy on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

# Running your application
You can run the application by typing `./gradlew clean run` on the project's root directory. It's going to start a server on `http://localhost:3000`

# Testing
Make a `GET` request on `http://localhost:3000/health` to see everything is working just fine.
